This section provides a comprehensive guide to using EOS in your own research.
In the `first subsection <basics.html>`_, the basic concepts, building blocks,
and terminology of EOS are introduced.
The next three subsections explain how to use EOS' low-level interface to perform the three main tasks of EOS:
how to `make theoretical prediction <predictions.html>`_;
how to `infer parameters <inference.html>`_ from experimental and/or theoretical data;
and how to `simulate processes <simulation.html>`_.
