"""
The `eos.figure` submodule provides means to produce publication-quality figures.

A figure contains one or more plots, each of which is a set of axis that can be
thought of as a 'canvas' to draw on.
A plot further contains items for display, for example a constraint in the form of
data points with error bars or an observable as a function of a kinematic variable
in the form or a line graph.
