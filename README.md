EOS - A software for Flavor Physics Phenomenology
=================================================

EOS is a software package that addresses several use cases in the field of
high-energy flavor physics:

 1. [theory predictions of and uncertainty estimation for flavor observables](https://eos.github.io/doc/use-cases.html#theory-predictions-and-their-uncertainties)
   within the Standard Model or within the Weak Effective Theory;
 2. [Bayesian parameter inference](https://eos.github.io/doc/use-cases.html#parameter-inference)
    from both experimental and theoretical constraints; and
 3. [Monte Carlo simulation of pseudo events](https://eos.github.io/doc/use-cases.html#pseudo-event-simulation) for flavor processes.

An up-to-date list of publications that use EOS can be found [here](https://eos.github.io/publications/).

EOS is written in C++20 and designed to be used through its Python 3 interface,
ideally within a Jupyter notebook environment.
It depends on as a small set of external software:

 - the GNU Scientific Library (libgsl),
 - a subset of the BOOST C++ libraries,
 - the Python 3 interpreter.

For details on these dependencies we refer to the [online documentation](https://eos.github.io/doc/installation.html#installing-the-dependencies-on-linux).

Installation
------------

EOS supports several methods of installation. For Linux users, the recommended method
is installation via PyPI:
```
pip3 install eoshep
```
Development versions tracking the master branch are also available via PyPi:
```
pip3 install --pre eoshep
```

For instructions on how to build and install EOS on your computer please have a
look at the [online documentation](https://eos.github.io/doc/installation.html).
